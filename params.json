I do not currently support relatively positioned popups.\r\n - Uses `$(window).resize` to reposition popups. I would highly suggest not unbinding.\r\n - Uses `$(document).click` to hide/show popups when clicked outside. I would highly suggest not unbinding.\r\n     - Stopping propagation any place in the document will cause this to fail.","tagline":"Javascript Popup manager"}
